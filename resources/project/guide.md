# PROJECT

This section provides description of basic requirements for the project.

## create git repository for the project (on github or any other hosting)
* learn about git concepts (commit, push, pull, branches, merging, .gitignore)
* send the repository link to Slack
* (the git commits should have meaningful descriptions)

## write project description (and add it to git)
* _decide what you want to do and write to me about it **first**_
* include team members (who's working on the project)
* add short description of the project
* scope (what parts will the project include) 
* estimates (how long each feature will take to implement)

## helpers
* you can use some form of task-tracking (the simplest one probably being _Trello_)
which will help you organize the work. 
If you decide to use any helpers for your project, include them in the description)
